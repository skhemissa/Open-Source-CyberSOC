## Technological Breakthrough
It could be interesting to consider the implementation of an operating system and middlewares that are not used in Corporate IS: this technological breakthrough reduces the risk of collateral damages on CyberSOC operations in case of Corporate IS compromise. 

> Open Source Operating System to consider:
> - [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/);
> - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/);
> - [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/);
> - [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/f).
> - if the organisation uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux), CentOS and Fedora should be avoided because both Linux flavours are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Dedicate IS vs Corporate IS
It's a real and fundamental position to be decided related to the hosting of the CyberSOC infrastructure: does the CyberSOC infrastructure have to be hosted in the Corporate IS or in a Dedicated IS?

Dedicated IS means networks, servers, authentication infrastructure, email servers, dhcp, dns, ntp, backups, internet access, monitoring, update servers, etc.

The implementation of a dedicated IS for the CyberSOC reduces the risk of collateral damages on CyberSOC operations in case of Corporate IS compromise.

The answer to this question is not trivial: the answer could be addressed by balancing the risk mentioned above and the cost of building a dedicated infrastructure and associated organisation and processes.

Building an IS based on open solutions is another subject. It is not covered in this initiative.

## Automation Engine
The automation engine accelerates and automates decision making on events. This purpose is achieved by streamlining manual and repetitive tasks in automated and orchestrated workflows based on rules, triggers, and events. In the context of a CyberSOC, these workflows are designed by "playbooks".

Example 1:
An alert, generated by the SIEM (eg. “SIEM” section) should be enriched by running a specific playbook:
1. Check in the asset database (e.g. “Ecosystem” section):

if so

2. Get criticality of assets concerned by the alert, its owners, assigned security officers, etc.;
3. When required, update alert severity;
4. For external resources concerned by the alert, get additional information eg. IP reputation, GeoIP, etc.;
5. For internal ressources concerned by the alerts :
  - Perform IP/domain lookups; 
  - Run a hunting task to get artefacts from the asset: process list dump, get  hashes, etc.;
  - Run analyses on collected artefacts (local tools or provided cloud services;
- (For critical incident) create a collaboration workgroup to simplify information sharing and invite stakeholders (eg. [Microsoft O365 Teams Channel API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-create-group-and-team));
- Assign the alert to the right security officer

Otherwise:

2. Get from the IPAM platform (e.g. “Ecosystem” section) the security officers assigned to subnet associated to internal IPs or the location concerned by the alert;
3. Assign the alert to the right security officer.

Example 2:
When a security bulletin related to a vulnerability is raised by a vendor or a CERT, a specific playbook is executed for security bulletin contextualization in the organisation:
Review in the asset database (e.g. “Ecosystem” section) if the concerned product is implemented in the organisation.
if so, the automation engine:
1. Check the criticality of the asset, remediation SLA, and get the asset owner;
2. For adjusting remediation priorities, get the level of exposure of concerned assets from firewall rules;
3. Notify asset owners,  additional stakeholders could be notified in case of emergency security bulletin vs. number of assets concerned vs. criticality of concerned assets;
4. Create remediation actions (e.g. “Core Components” section) with a calculated priority, a due date and assigned to the asset owner ... automatic remediation could also be considered;
5. When the remediation is done, execute a vulnerability scan for ensuring that the remediation is efficient.
Otherwise no action is done.

## CyberSOC Data Store
Some tools used by the CyberSOC generate data that are interesting for further analysis or for reporting purposes. A dedicated database for consolidating such data should be considered.  
> Open source database:
> - [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/);
> - [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/documentation/).

Data stored in the database must be accessed using a standard interface. RestAPI for accessing such data should be considered. Some solutions act as a RestAPI gateway between a requester and a database.
> Open source solutions:
> - [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org) for Postgresql;
> - [MaxScale](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/maxscale/) for MariaDB.

## Project Management and Issues Tracker
Building a CyberSOC is a complete and complex project that involves multiple stakeholders. It's important to use a robust and flexible solution for managing this project.
Furthermore, a lot of actions such as vulnerabilities and post-incident remediations are raised by the CyberSOC. These actions must be followed up and reported.

> - [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/).

## Development Platform
The development of new services requires a lot of developments that should be centralised in one place. This place is also the opportunity to have strong collaboraton between team members. 
> Open Source solution:
> - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)

## Knowledge Management
A wiki for consolidating knowledge and information such as processes, installations documents, technical manuals, etc. should be considered.
> Open source solutions:
> - [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki);
> - [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki);
> - [PmWiki](https://www.pmwiki.org/);
> - [Tiki](https://tiki.org/).
> - ….
## Business Intelligence and Reporting
Business Intelligence and reporting are important for:
1. The follow-up of the CyberSOC operations performances;
2. Improving the services of the CyberSOC;
3. Providing the visibility and the value of the CyberSOC to external and internal stakeholders.

## Securing access to CyberSOC services
The access to the CyberSOC services must be protected by an IPSec VPN with Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), even from internal networks.
> Open source solution:
> - VPN: [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/);
> - MFA: **TODO**.

## Peoples
A skilled technical core team must be considered.
This team is : 
1. Accountable for maintaining the consistency of the software architecture/urbanization (especially when several solutions offer the same functionality) and the security of the CyberSOC IS;
2. Responsible of developing the technical part of the services that will be described in next sections;
3. Responsible for managing, including patching and upgrading, all the technical components of the CyberSOC IS.
